# Air Sea Coupling Project

This repository provides the source code, functions, and figures for the analysis of MITgcm output to answer the following science question: 

> How well do ocean models perform close to the coastline of California? 

with the underlying questions being *What dynamics (coastal dynamics such as cross-shelf exchange, and dynamics occurring at scales spanning the transitions from balanced motions at the mesoscale to unbalanced motions at the frontal scale) are missing from our models?*. 

By using your model output along with a combination of in-situ and remotely-sensed observations from Gliders, HFR, SWOT and PACE, we aim to evaluate the model's performance in the California coastal regime.
